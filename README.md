# Kade Korn – Data Analyst Portfolio

This is my personal data analytics portfolio website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled using Tailwind CSS. It showcases my work, tools, and experiences as a data analyst passionate about uncovering insights and solving problems.

## 🚀 Live Site

[Coming soon – deployed on Vercel]

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- TypeScript

## 📁 Features

- Responsive portfolio layout
- Sections for About, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact
- Easily configurable via a central `portfolio.ts` file

## 🛠 Customization

All content is stored in `src/utils/portfolio.ts` and pulled dynamically into the layout. Swap out project data, update skills, and tweak animations without changing layout code.
